    <h3>Description</h3>
    The No-Bean Chili is perfect for people who don't like<br>
    the spiciness of traditional chili, who don't digest<br>
    beans very well or simply for people that like chili, <br>
    but want to put a different spin on it.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon bacon grease</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef, preferably chuck</li>
        <li>½ medium white onion, minced</li>
        <li>8 cloves garlic, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground paprika</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can tomato puree</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cube beef bouillon</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat bacon grease in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in <br>
          the hot pot until almost browned, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and add <br>
          onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion has softened and turned<br>
           translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add garlic, chili powder, paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until<br>
          fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomato puree, water, tomato paste, sugar, and bouillon<br>
          cube. Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 to 60<br>
          minutes.</li>
      </ol>
