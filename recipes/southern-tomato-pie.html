    <h3>Description</h3>
    Tomato slices are juicy and mix in well with the creamy/cheesy "custard" in this Southern-<br>
    inspired tomato pie. The blind baking method helps keep the crust nice and crunchy on<br>
     the bottom.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>½ (14.1 ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts, at room temperature</li>
        <li>3 medium tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 ¼ teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 large clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon thinly sliced fresh basil</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><p>
            Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Fit pie crust inside a 9-inch pie plate,<br>
            pressing into the bottom and up the sides of the plate. Fold crust edges under; crimp<br>
            as desired. Place a piece of parchment paper over crust in pie plate, leaving a 3-inch<br>
            overhang. Fill with pie weights or dried beans.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Carefully remove parchment paper and<br>
            pie weights. Continue baking until crust is light golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes more.<br>
            Transfer to a wire rack; cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Reduce oven<br>
            temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Meanwhile, slice tomatoes crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices; arrange tomato slices<br>
            in a single layer on paper towels. Sprinkle with 3/4 teaspoon of the salt; let stand for<br>
            20 minutes. Pat tomato slices dry with paper towels.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Whisk together mayonnaise and cream cheese until combined and smooth. Fold in 1<br>
            1/4 cups Cheddar cheese, egg, flour, garlic, cayenne, black pepper, and remaining 1/2<br>
            teaspoon salt until combined.</p></li>
        <li><p>Spread half of the Cheddar mixture in the pie crust. Layer with 1/3 of the tomato<br>
            slices in slightly overlapping circles. Repeat procedure with remaining Cheddar<br>
            mixture and another third of tomato slices. Top with remaining tomato slices in<br>
            slightly overlapping circles. Sprinkle with Parmesan and remaining 1/4 cup Cheddar<br>
            cheese.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Bake pie in the preheated oven until filling is set and lightly browned on top, 30 to 35<br>
            minutes, tenting crust with aluminum foil to prevent excess browning, if needed. Let<br>
            stand for at least 30 minutes before serving. Garnish with thinly sliced basil before<br>
            serving.
        </p></li>
      </ol>
